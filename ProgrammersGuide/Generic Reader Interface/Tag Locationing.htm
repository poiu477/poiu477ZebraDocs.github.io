<h2>Tag Locationing</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">Readers which support Tag Locationing
feature report the same in the field isTagLocationingSupported of
ReaderCapabilities as true. This feature is supported only on
Handheld readers and is useful to locate a specific tag in the
field of view of the reader&#146;s antenna. The default
locationing algorithm supported on the reader can perform
locationing only on a single antenna.
reader.Actions.TagLocationing.Perform can be used to start
locating a tag, and reader.Actions.TagLocationing.Stop to stop
the locationing operation. Result of locationing of a tag is
reported as LocationInfo in TagData and will be present in
TagData if tagData isContainsLocationInfo is true.
tagData.LocationInfo.getRelativeDistance gives the relative
distance of the Tag from the Reader Antenna. </p>
